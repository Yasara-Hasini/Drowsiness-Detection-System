# Drowsiness-Detection-System
This is a project we did for the SPARK Challenge organized by Electronic Club of University of Moratuwa. In this project we were addressing a timely problem most of us face which is drowsy driving accidents. To give a solution to this problem, we designed a system which has few features to detect the drowsiness of a person. They are, 
  * Eye movement detection
  * Yawning detection
  * Distraction detection
  * GPS tracking
  * High speed tracking
  
By observing these features, our system check whether the driver is in the drawsy condition or not. This system will give a warning to the driver. Also, our system has an alert messaging system to send messages to their family members if the driver is in a drawsy condition.
